Customer Analysis Repository

This repository includes a project that analyzes customer data and builds predictive models to forecast customer spendings. The analysis involves the following steps:


Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features for the model.

Modeling: Building a predictive model using Random Forest Regressor.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the model's parameters.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like R^2, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

This project aims to predict customer behavior and provide insights for targeted marketing and business decisions.
